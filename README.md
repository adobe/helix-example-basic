## Prerequisites
TODO explain what's needed and point to the Getting Started guide

## Overview
> So far this is more a skeleton than a complete example, it needs to be fleshed out but already
> demonstrates the idea of standalone examples including integration tests that validate them
> along with the whole publishing chain. Discussion at [#27](https://github.com/adobe/helix-home/issues/27).

It demonstrates a basic website with a few pages, a header and a footer,
all in Markdown format, along with a simple custom CSS stylesheet and a few images.

By default, this example Helix website is published at https://helix-example-basic-adobe.project-helix.page/ . If you forked this repository, replace `adobe` with your GitHub username in that URL.

To access other Helix examples use [This GitHub query](https://github.com/topics/helix-example) - each example is found in its own GitHub repository.

For more info on Helix see https://www.project-helix.io/

_TODO: complete this example so it fits the below description_

 _TODO: refine the GitHub query, in a specific org only?_

## How to play with this example
You can modifiy the `*.md` files at will and add new ones. Changes that are pushed to the master branch of this
repository are published automatically, within a few seconds. _TODO add caching info_.

For now the only 'magic' files are `header.md` and `footer.md`, other files are considered to be pages of your Helix website.

## Automated tests
This example is validated with CircleCI using tests defined in the `test-code` branch of this repository to avoid
cluttering this branch with test code.

You can safely ignore these tests if you're just playing with the example.
